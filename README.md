# MLtRS
Machine Learning through R Shiny (MLtRS) is open source server level web application developed by using RShiny. The application right now supports the following algorithms. 

I.  Supervised Learning 
  1.  Logistic regression
  2.  kNN
  3.  SVM
  4.  Decision Trees 
  5.  Random Forests
  6.  Naive Bayes Classifier
  7.  Neural Networks
  
II.  Unsupervised Learning
  1.  PCA
  2.  Gaussian Mixture Modeling 
  3.  Novelty & Outlier Detection
  4.  Fuzzy C-Means Clustering 
  5.  Manifold Learnign (MDS) [yet to be implemented]
  
The application depends on following packages:

1.  shiny
2.  shinydashboard
3.  nortest
4.  mvnormtest
5.  MASS
6.  shinyLP
7.  class
8.  gmodels
9.  caret
10. rattle
11. ranger
12. klaR
13. kernlab
14. micad
15. e1071
16. NeuralNetTools
17. neuralnet
18. nnet
19. mclust
